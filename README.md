# MissingPoster

[The Missing Poster project](http://MissingPoster.BlueToque.ca) is a tool that can be used to write a missing poster for someone who is lost or missing. 

The tool was created over a period of three days after I participated in a large search for a 
[missing woman near Vancouver, British Columbia](http://blog.oplopanax.ca/2012/08/my-first-large-search-initial-thoughts/). 
I saw a SAR member putting together a missing person poster using Microsoft Paint and I thought that there should be a better way.

This tool prompts the user for the pertinent information, gives an easy way to import the photo, and can create the missing 
person photo in a variety of file formats. If the information changes, it can be edited easily.
